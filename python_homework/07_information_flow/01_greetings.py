# We've written a helper function for you called greet(name) which takes as input a string name and prints a greeting. Write some code in main() to get the user's name and then greet them, being sure to call the greet(name) helper function.

# Here's a sample run of the program (user input in bold italics):

# What's your name? Sophia

# Greetings Sophia!

def greetFunc(name):
    if not name:
        return "Please Enter Your Name"
    else:
        return f"Greetings {name}!"

userName = input("Enter Your Name : ")
print(greetFunc(userName))
