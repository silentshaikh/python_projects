# Fill out the get_name() function to return your name as a string! We've written a main() function for you which calls your function to retrieve your name and then prints it in a greeting.

# Here's a sample run of the program where the name we've decided to return is Sophia (the autograder expects the returned name to be Sophia):

# Howdy Sophia ! ðŸ¤ 

def getName(name):
    return f"Howdy {name} !"

print(getName("Sophia"))
