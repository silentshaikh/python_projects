# Fill out the double(num) function to return the result of multiplying num by 2. We've written a main() function for you which asks the user for a number, calls your code for double(num) , and prints the result.

# Here's a sample run of the program (user input in bold italics):

# Enter a number: 2 Double that is 4

def doubleNum(numList):
    for num in numList:
        print(num*2)

doubleNum([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])
